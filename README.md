## Parallel Processing and High Performance Computing (HPC) Presentation

This repository contains a presentation for EPI 560 on parallel processing 
and high performance computing. The intended audience are R users with little 
or no experience with using servers to run R. There are also a few additional 
R scripts for demo purposes. The slides are in an Rmd file which can be 
rendered into HTML slides using the "knit" feature of RStudio.
