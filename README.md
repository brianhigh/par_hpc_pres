This repo contains a presentation for EPI 560 on parallel and high performance computing. 
The intended audience are R users with little or no experience with using servers to run R. 
There are also a few additional R scripts for demo purposes. The slides are in an Rmd file 
which can be rendered into HTML slides using the "knit" feature of RStudio.
